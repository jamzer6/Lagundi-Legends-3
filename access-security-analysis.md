# Access Security Analysis

## Current Security State
1. The application uses Firebase Authentication for user management
2. There is a ProtectedRoute component, but it's not properly utilized
3. The `/admin` route (AdminDashboard) is currently accessible without authentication
4. User roles are stored in Firestore during registration, but not being used for authorization

## Security Issues
1. The AdminDashboard is directly exposed in App.tsx without any protection
2. The ProtectedRoute component only redirects to "pagelogin" which appears to be an incorrect path
3. No role-based access control implementation for admin routes

## Recommendation
The admin route should be protected using the ProtectedRoute component with additional role-based verification to ensure only admin users can access it.
