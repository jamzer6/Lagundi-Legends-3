# Can you access the admin dashboard without logging in?

No, you cannot access the admin dashboard without logging in as a developer or any other user. Here's why:

## Security Implementation

1. The admin route `/admin` is protected by the `ProtectedRoute` component:
```tsx
<Route path="/admin" element={<ProtectedRoute><AdminDashboard /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

2. The ProtectedRoute component checks authentication status using Firebase:
```tsx
const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

## What happens when you try to access /admin without login?

1. When you try to visit `/admin` directly:
   - The ProtectedRoute component checks your authentication status
   - Since you're not logged in, `isAuthenticated` will be `false`
   - You are automatically redirected to the `/login` page

2. To access the admin dashboard:
   - First, you must visit `/login`
   - Enter valid credentials
   - Once authenticated, you can then access `/admin`

## Technical Implementation Details

The security is implemented through multiple layers:

1. Firebase Authentication for user management
2. React Router for route protection
3. ProtectedRoute component for access control
4. AuthContext for maintaining authentication state

This ensures that unauthorized access attempts are automatically redirected to the login page.
