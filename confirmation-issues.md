## Confirmation.tsx Issues

1. **No Form Validation for Date and Service**
   - The component checks if date and service exist, but doesn't validate their format or content
   - Should add proper validation before allowing submission

2. **Incomplete Error Handling**
   - Error messages are generic ("Failed to book the appointment")
   - No specific error handling for different types of failures
   - Error state isn't cleared when retrying

3. **User Experience Issues**
   - No way to go back or cancel the booking process
   - Loading state shows only "Loading..." without visual indicator
   - No confirmation dialog before final booking

4. **Security Concerns**
   - No input sanitization for user data before sending to service
   - No validation of date to prevent past dates or invalid time slots

5. **State Management**
   - Location state could be undefined (no fallback default date/service)
   - No handling of page refresh which would lose state
   - No proper cleanup of error/loading states
